target_issue = $ARGUMENTS

If target_issue is not provided, ask the user which issue to explain.

## Step 1: Gather Issue Information

Run the following in parallel:

- Get the issue description and metadata: `gh issue view <issue_number>`
- Get the issue comments: `gh issue view <issue_number> --comments`

If the issue references related pull requests, commits, or files that are needed to understand the solution, gather that context as well.

## Step 2: Analyze and Explain

Based on the issue content, explain the following two aspects:

1. **Background (Problem/Motivation):** What problem, limitation, or user need does this issue describe? Why does it matter?
2. **Proposed Solution:** What solution, direction, or next step is suggested in the issue discussion? Summarize the expected approach, scope, and important constraints if they are mentioned.

If the issue does not contain enough information about the solution, explicitly say that the solution is still undecided or unspecified.

Keep the explanation concise and focused. Use the language of the current conversation (follow the user's language).
